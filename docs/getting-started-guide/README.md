# Getting Started Guide

a substream consists of a few files / folder

* `manifest.yaml` : A YAML file that defines the modules and their dependancy
* `protobuf`: In your `manifest.yaml` you will define custom types to represents your models, those will be defined in `protobuf` definition files.&#x20;
* `rust handler` : A `src` folder that will contain your `substream` rust code of the `module handlers` defined in your `manifest.yaml`
