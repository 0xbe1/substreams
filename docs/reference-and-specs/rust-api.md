# Rust APIs

We offer an official [`Substreams`](https://crates.io/crates/substreams) crate that you can use to develop your handlers.

For Chain-specific `substreams-[network]` crates, you can use the appropriate API for your chain:

* ``[`substreams-ethereum`](https://crates.io/crates/substreams-ethereum) for Ethereum.
* ``[`substreams-solana`](https://crates.io/crates/substreams-solana) for Solana
