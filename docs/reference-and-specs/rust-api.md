# Rust APIs

We offer an official [`Substreams`](https://docs.rs/substreams/latest/substreams/) crate that you can use to develop your handlers.

For Chain-specific `substreams-[network]` crates, you can use the appropriate API for your chain:

* [`substreams-ethereum`](https://docs.rs/substreams-ethereum) for Ethereum.
